Network Scanning

IP scan only:
    sudo nmap -sn 10.0.0-1.0-255    # specifying ranges of search. 
    # (use eth or wifi ip as guide to available networks)
    # sudo allows it to get more information - not a requirement

Detailed single IP scan:
    # Looks at all ports too
    sudo nmap -A -T4 10.0.0.100

Use first the numbers of MAC address to identify the manufacturer:

        $: sudo nmap -sn 10.0.0.0-255
        >> Nmap scan report for 10.0.0.100
        >> Host is up (-0.12s latency).
        >> MAC Address: 14:1F:78:5C:A6:FE (Unknown)
        ...
