Blender Tutorial Notes:
    middle: 3D viewboard
    right: Properties
Split View:
    top left hand 3 lines
    bottom creates horizontal cut
    collapsing requires a full shared side
    
Navigation:
    Middle mouse: orbiting
    Shift middle: panning

    Numpad 7, 1, 3 top, front side
    Numpad . direct into focus
    Numpad Perspective/Orthographic

    Right click: select
        *change user_preferences to select with left


Objects:
    Shift + A:  add object
                usually mesh
                Change attributes only at start- not alterable afterward
    X: delete
    Spacebar: search-bar


    s: scaling * mouse now scales object
    cntrl + s: quantized increments/decrements
        Scale along axis
        x:
        y:
        z:

    Arrows: move along axis
        red, green, blue x,y,z
        x:
        y:
        z:
        or hold middle mouse and 
        r: rotate
            rotate along axis
            x:
            y:
            z:

    g: move with mouse parallel to view


wrench: modifier Panel
    'non destructive'
    subdivision smoother
    
Play animation:
    alt + A

Mode:
    Object: individual object moving
    Edit: <TAB> cycle between the two
        Looks at a particular object

        vertici mode
                select verticies
            shift + select: select several
            alt + select entire row
        edge mode
        face select

g: allows scaling rotate etc for edges/vertec selected
o: proportional editing mode
    scroll wheel changes area of influence
    different modes of falloff influence
    random
b: left click drag select
    middle drag deselect
a: select all/cycle
    * works in all modes
c: circle select
    middle mouse
        deselect
Selects what you can actually SEE

limit selection to visible at bottom/ cycle

Z: Solid-view/ wire-frame mode


Shift + d : duplicate
l: select whole mesh linked 

p: separate by selection

e: extrude


Modify: solidify add thickness
    Modifiers have order
    can be changed


Cycles is the new Renderer
Render slots to compare different renders - J

H: Hiding
    alt H unhide
only hides in viewport not renderer

Shading type rendered
Numpad 0
Great representation without full rendering
    Shift Z between render and normal

Shading
    Toolbar smooth shading

Toolbar: T on/off



Properties:
    materials

Diffuse:
    no reflection
Glossy:
    metal
Can combine them:
    diffuse + glossy

Node Editor
    Cube on bottom left
    shift A add node
    Mix-shader + multiple nodes to combine shaders
        release on top of connection with auto combine 
        node colors should match generally




Perfromance Tips:
    portals to remove unnecessary lighting
    bounces
    use gpu
    tile size
    samples
    denoising
    clamping - indirect ()
    caustics - only liquids really
    shared intacing
    adaptive subdivision
        in subsurf modifier
    remove alpha transparancy
    strand count/particles
    volumnetrics/ fog
    subsurface scattering
    enable mis -  multiple import enhancing 
    performance:
        use spacial splits
        use hair bvh




Micro-polygon displacement is applied at time of rendering
Genuine displacement




* on import change division details
* pro lighting skies
environmental light
need to change displacement method
    Use True
* needs phys geo



Experimental SetL
geom:
    subdi rate

material
    change display type
subserf mod
     adaptive



no color data into displacement
need to subdivide
subdivide
subsurf

using adaptive means view levels make no level

    dicing scale

Tab*2 refresh


cntrl + alt + num0: set cameras to here


cntrl + a : recale to 1

Preview render amount
    1px to 9px


jpg 8 bit image, need 16 bit displacement for finer grain 

    tiff file


resolution 100%









m: move object to another layer

n: properties:
    backgrond images, add image
    only visible in orthogrpahic (side, left top)

alt-click, select whole edge
cntrl + R : add edge

gg: slide edge again

cntrl 1,2,3,4, sub-surf modifier

proximity loop to tighten up
alt +n: merge
i: inset : fix circular edge
e: extrude
z: wireframe view

+- keys adds numer to save file

connect faces: select verticies
f: join edges
make sure no faces inside an objects volume
smooth mode shows up mesh issues

cntrl a : rescale

items appear where the curso is

change face to nogon to fill circle
solidify mod to give thickness
shift + F5- 3D view

Textures:
poliigon

texture and normal map
*image texture*
looks for uv map
view to uv injector

edit mode: u: uv menu
where to put the scicrros

cntrl e to make seam


roughnees is normal map

normal map node to convert image to not use colours

can drag in images to blender node editor



Particles:
shift + z: scale on every axis except z

mirror modifyer:
     clipping will join sides


particles:
    second fro mleft
    hair vs emitter

in properties tab  face normals
cntrl + shift + n : clear norms
affected by modifiers
offset
advanced settings all the time
rotation
physics:
 size



group:
shift select all
cntrl + g

cntrl and shift 0.1 cntrl shift 0.01

select last
cntrl + l copy informationbetween objects

click material number to make singular and not sharing material
painting where more should be
    vertex groups in particle settings

join objects toether: cntrl + j
need to apply modifying to individual objects before.

alt+ TAB: weight paint mode

Lighting:
    sun lamp is globally affected- position doesn't matter
    blend -  more feather shadows
    size too affects shadows
    larger gives smoother light
    smaller is sharper shadows
   lamp wont show up in reflections
   mesh lamp will


 world lighting:
    white washes out scene
         use black 0
     blue contributes slight blue
     never as primary light source
     HDR: entire lighting scene
         environment texture
         to colour of emission
     Prolighting skies from Blender Guru


r + middle mouse button loking through camera to move
g+ middle zoom
g + x.y.z


assigne in mesh to  change material used around object
click colour down to viewport


Rendering:
    render settigns use GPU device
    tiles:
    grain/noise: low samples is grainy.
         interior: sample needs high
         exterior: less
         resolution percentage
        fireflies, tiny specks: glass or water caustins is more common
        fewer colours is better
        hue-saturation node to tone town texture images
        duality- both things demanding foucs - bad
             make one thing in focuus
         focal lenght is zoom, not position of camera
depth of field - photo realism - focus on object
   or use camera limits
 aperture defines sensitivity to focus
        rather use f-stop


Compositor:
    liek photoshop
Node editor - use compositor
load render into
tehre is a viewre and ocmposite output node
glare
coloour balance
little orange to make warmer

UV unwrapping


lazy way:
u - msart uv project

cntrl e- mark seam with edge selecxted
red in z-mode
with manuak
use u - unwrap

uv mode
l to connect to the whole 'island'
n:  stretch in display, heat map of stretch
use sync selextion to sleect inboth panes



bounces
4  diffuse glossy and treansmission
06

6 transparancey and 2.00 filter glossy max 6 bounces

tile_size: auto tile size

light settins
light bounces 4
multiple importance

hdr maps
bounces 4ish

use denoising

shift z while scaleing: only scale along x and y

proportional editing - o
can chnage function
change size with scrool wheel
if you hide vericies they arent moved - h
alt+h - return hidden


boolean operation:
choose object
often messes mesh
alt+ click shaows direction
sub-ser shows issue

k: knife tool draws verticies
c: constrain to angle

extra edges- gg move all the way to double verticies
w: to remove doubles
alt +m: merge indicies


object_settings,
draw type to wire for boolean shape

mirror operator

before apply on a modifier, move to trash layer
can use clipping

f: make a face

keep mesh lean, use sub-surf

shift+ e -  make a crease (not affected by sub-surf)
has a magnitude
not high control, maximum is okay
midway not so much

loop cuts on both sides for control


i: inset to make internal face
b: will elliminate boundary


f: while holding two triangles; - will make a face

loop cut:
    e: sticks to shape makes even
    f:

merge verticies
alt+m

w: remove doubles


shadiing:
matcap to change solid colour
